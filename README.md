# photo-widgetizer

A photo site designed with widgetization in mind for all elements, including the photo gallery's title section and an 'Add Photo' feature. This site should allow users to effortlessly manage and display their photographs, ensuring each component, from the title to the gallery itself, is customizable and interactive. The aim is to provide a seamless user experience, facilitating the addition, removal, and viewing of photos with ease. The design should be clean, modern, and responsive, catering to both desktop and mobile users.
